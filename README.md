# Nobody Nuker
Ever since the discord.py 2.0 update, all nukes you find....are basically broken. Channel and role spam at best.
So, if you want to destroy a person's server for craps and giggles, this is the awnser while keeping complete(ish) anonymity
With extensive testing, this can go up to 2.5k pings before getting rate limited. May be small but its enough to devestate a server.
However it has some downsides
## Disadvantages
- All tokens inputed are single use
- ...thats all I can think of

---
In conclusion, this is the only (to my knowledge) nuke based on discord.py that works. Have at it I guess
